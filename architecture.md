# Customer Survey Application - Microservices Architecture

## 1. Overall Architecture

The Customer Survey Application is built using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. Each microservice focuses on a specific domain of the application and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs.
